_Last update: **September 2019**_

This blog lives on [GitHub Pages], and my personal computer is running Windows 10. This is a lot like owning a cat and a dog. With enough time and effort, they'll begrudgingly tolerate each other, and not much else.

Back in the dark ages, I used to commit and push every single tweak to see how [Jekyll]/GHP/my theme behaved. You can look through this blog's commit history for multiple fun sessions of 5-6 straight commits trying to wrestle with CSS.

In the slightly less dark ages (2017), I initially posted this walkthrough. It was long, and it sucked. I mean, it worked, but it was a journey. There's a reason we call it bleeding edge technology.

Now, Ubuntu on Windows is mainstream, and making this happen is pretty painless. Technology works sometimes!*

_\* - [footage not found]_

The instructions below are a drastically simplified 2019 overhaul of my 2017 process.

### One-Time Install

Enable [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)]. This requires a reboot.

```posh
# Run PowerShell as administrator
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
```

Upon restart:

- Open the Microsoft Store > Ubuntu app > Install, then Launch
- Set up a username and password for use only in Ubuntu

Now you have a bash prompt, something like `brian@COMPUTER:~$`

```bash
# Update all packages
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
# (sudo will prompt for the password you just created)
```

Using Ubuntu instead of local Win10 makes this a million times easier. Copying [Jekyll on Ubuntu]:

```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev

# Prefer installing gems for your user instead of root
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Install Jekyll and Bundler
gem install jekyll bundler
```

[Here] are the previous instructions, in case you want to smile at this point like I am.

### On Each Run

Search for "Ubuntu" in the Windows start menu. Run the app.

```bash
# You'll probably be told "X packages can be updated." upon launch
# Update all packages
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade

# Go to the directory you cloned your blog repo to
# Tab completion works, but case-sensitivity matters
cd /mnt/c/Users/brianbunke/OneDrive/GitHub/brianbunke.github.io/

# Run jekyll
jekyll serve
```

Then, as referenced in the Bash window, you can hit `http://127.0.0.1:4000` in your browser to view the locally generated version of your site.

If you want to make any tweaks while Jekyll is running, it's also watching. You'll see a "Regenerating:" line in the Bash window after each save, after which you can simply refresh your browser.

Running `jekyll serve` may pollute Git with a bunch of extra files. If so, add these three lines to your `.gitignore` file:

```git
# Jekyll Specific
_site/
.jekyll-cache/
```

Local previews make the writing/editing process far more tolerable, and removed the only real pain point I was feeling after migrating to [GitHub Pages]. But of course, don't take my word for it, it's your turn to try it out!
