At VMworld US 2019, [Kyle Ruddy] and I presented a session named "Introduction to PowerCLI." In it, we demonstrated how to get started with [VMware PowerCLI] to manage and automate your VMware environments. The goal was to make the command line a little more familiar -- and a little less intimidating -- especially if you have never used PowerCLI or [PowerShell] before.

About half the session was spent performing a live demo, because my hope is you can follow along back at your desk with the session recording and the exact code I used. The editor in the demo is [Visual Studio Code], allowing a consistent experience for any user. PowerShell, PowerCLI, and VS Code are all free and cross-platform.

If you are interested in learning how to use PowerCLI in a walkthrough that gradually introduces core PowerShell patterns, consider grabbing the code and watching the video.
